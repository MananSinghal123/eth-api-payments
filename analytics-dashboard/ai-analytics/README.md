# ðŸ¤– AI Analytics Layer for API Payment Intelligence

## Overview
This AI analytics layer processes real-time substreams data to provide intelligent insights, predictions, and optimizations for the API payment ecosystem.

## Features

### 1. **Payment Pattern Recognition**
- User behavior classification (power users, occasional users, at-risk users)
- Provider performance scoring and tier classification
- Anomaly detection for fraud prevention

### 2. **Predictive Analytics**
- Usage forecasting based on historical patterns
- Optimal deposit timing recommendations
- Churn probability scoring

### 3. **Cost Optimization Engine**
- Real-time cost analysis using Token API data
- Alternative payment token suggestions
- Batch optimization recommendations

### 4. **Network Intelligence**
- Ecosystem relationship mapping
- Provider reliability scoring
- Market efficiency analysis

## AI Models

1. **User Behavior Classifier** - Random Forest model for user segmentation
2. **Anomaly Detector** - Isolation Forest for fraud detection
3. **Usage Predictor** - LSTM for time series forecasting
4. **Cost Optimizer** - Multi-objective optimization for payment efficiency

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Integration

The AI layer connects to:
- PostgreSQL (historical data)
- MongoDB (flexible queries)  
- WebSocket (real-time updates)
- Token API (market data)
