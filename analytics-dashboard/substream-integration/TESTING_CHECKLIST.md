# Real Blockchain Testing Checklist

## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] StreamingFast API Token (you have this)
- [x] Deployed Escrow Contract (0x6E5559e7Cf01860416ff9CbEcC3bbdC1f05dB3D0)
- [x] Sink Service Built & Running
- [x] Frontend Connected

## Next Steps for Real Data

### 1. Update Contract Address in Rust Code
Edit `src/lib.rs` and update:
```rust
const ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: [u8; 20] = hex!("6E5559e7Cf01860416ff9CbEcC3bbdC1f05dB3D0");
```

### 2. Rebuild the WASM Module
```bash
cd analytics-dashboard/substream-integration
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### 3. Test Real Substream (Optional)
```bash
# This requires substreams CLI and might need authentication
substreams run substream.yaml map_escrow_events -e sepolia.eth.streamingfast.io:443
```

### 4. Switch to Real Data Mode
Update `sink-service/src/stream-consumer.ts` to use real substream instead of mock data.

## Current Status: DEVELOPMENT READY ✅

Your setup is perfect for development with:
- ✅ Mock data generation (5-second intervals)
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket streaming
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints
- ✅ Frontend integration
- ✅ Connection management
- ✅ Error handling

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Cloud Deployment
- [ ] Deploy sink service to Vercel/Railway/AWS
- [ ] Update CORS_ORIGIN to your domain
- [ ] Set production environment variables
- [ ] Configure SSL for WebSocket (wss://)
- [ ] Set up monitoring/logging

### Contract Events
- [ ] Verify contract has recent activity
- [ ] Test with a small transaction
- [ ] Monitor gas costs and block times
- [ ] Set appropriate START_BLOCK

### Performance
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent connections
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Set up connection limits
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
